# AGENTS.md — rules for every coding agent in this repo

Read first: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if present), your task, and `docs/coordinator.md` if you coordinate. For how the product works, start with `docs/developer.md`.

## Repository boundary

- This clone works on the fork `bussard76/exxperts` (`origin`). `EXXETA/exxperts` (`upstream`) is read-only.
- **Never push to `EXXETA/exxperts` and never open a pull request, issue or comment there.** Pass `--repo bussard76/exxperts` to every `gh` call that writes.
- Only Sascha contributes to EXXETA, from the separate clone `~/Development/exxperts-upstream`, which holds no factory files. `tools/exxeta-pr-guard.sh` rejects pushes of factory files on branches bound for EXXETA (`exxeta/*` or an open PR there).

## Layout

- `pi-package/` — extensions, skills, product-state path helpers
- `runtime/` — owned exxperts runtime packages (Pi fork)
- `apps/web-server/` — Fastify server: rooms, memory lifecycle, tool policy
- `apps/web-ui/` — React/Vite web UI
- `scripts/` — dev launchers (`exxperts-cli`, `exxperts-web`)
- `bin/` — packaged bin shim
- `docs/` — architecture, ops, developer docs (start with `docs/developer.md`)

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run build              # build all workspaces
./scripts/exxperts-web      # dev web app
./scripts/exxperts-cli      # dev CLI/TUI
npm run smokes              # smoke suite, must pass before integrating
npm run doctor              # env sanity check
```

After editing `runtime/`: `cd runtime && npm run build && cd ..`

## Conventions

- Workspaces: `runtime/packages/*`, `pi-package`, `apps/web-server`, `apps/web-ui`
- Two dev loops, keep separate: repo scripts (`./scripts/exxperts-*`) vs installed tarball (`npm pack` + `npm exec --package ./*.tgz -- exxperts`)
- Full details: `docs/developer.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/how-exxperts-works.md`

## Way of working

- **One task, its scope only.** Do exactly the task you were given. Out-of-scope findings go into your final report; do not fix them.
- **Think before you build.** State your assumptions first. If a task can be read several ways, name the readings instead of picking one silently. If something is unclear, stop and ask the coordinator. If a simpler way exists, say so.
- **Simplest thing that works.** Nothing beyond what was asked: no speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no unrequested configurability, no error handling for impossible cases. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite them.
- **Surgical changes.** Every changed line traces to your task. Match the existing style, and leave adjacent code, comments and formatting alone. Remove only what your own change made unused; mention other dead code in your report.
- **Verifiable goals.** Turn the task into checks you can run, and for several steps write a short plan with one check per step. Keep going until they pass.
- **TDD.** For every behaviour: write a failing test first, make it pass, then refactor. Test through public entry points, not internals.
- **Done means:** `npm run build && npm run smokes` is green, the task's acceptance checks pass, and your report lists files changed, tests added and any assumptions.
- **Never weaken tests.** Do not delete, skip or loosen existing tests. If a test is wrong, escalate.
- **Small commits** on your branch with clear messages. Push your branch; never push to `main`.
- **DCO sign-off:** commit with `git commit -s`.
- **Docs:** update `docs/` if user-visible behaviour changed.

## Review gate

- No code reaches `main` without a passing independent review under `docs/review-protocol.md`. The reviewer is never the builder. Enforced by the factory hooks in `.githooks/` (`tools/factory-guardrails.mjs`). With the hooks armed (`core.hooksPath=.githooks`), `pre-push` checks every update of `main`.
- Reviewers work read-only and write only their findings file, committed separately under `docs/reviews/`.
- Builders fix findings. If a finding appears incorrect, explain why to the coordinator.
- `--no-verify` is forbidden, and so is every other way of skipping hooks (`HUSKY=0`, `core.hooksPath` changes, `git -c core.hooksPath=…`).

## Coordinator

Whoever coordinates work (starts workers, merges, or talks to Sascha) follows `docs/coordinator.md`.

## Change levels

Every task records `## Architecture impact` (level, modules and boundaries; level 3 needs an ADR). A fresh Worker Architect checks every spec before the build and conformance after level 2/3 builds; see `docs/architect-protocol.md`. One exception, ADR-0005: a bug fix whose ticket states the diagnosis and the exact change, and which the Controller itself finds to be level 1, takes the slim lane without a separate spec review.

| Level | Examples | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | anything inside one module that keeps its public API | just do it |
| 2 | new or changed public export, new dependency, new route | checked by the Architect; ask the coordinator with a one-paragraph rationale; continue only after the answer |
| 3 | new module, changed responsibilities or allowed imports, different data flow, new technology, contract or protocol change | escalate; the coordinator gets Sascha's decision; do not implement until the accepted ADR says `Decided by: Sascha` |

**Protected files** (the commit hook blocks changes unless the message references `ADR-NNNN` of an accepted ADR that carries a `Decided by:` line): `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/adr/**`, `.githooks/**`, `tools/factory-guardrails.mjs`. A **new or proposed ADR** is itself under `docs/adr/`: commit it by citing the adoption ADR (ADR-0001) in the message; once Sascha has accepted it, cite it directly. ADRs follow `docs/adr/0000-template.md` (Status, Date, Decided by, options, decision), not the shorter form in the vendored `domain-modeling` skill. New dependencies are not hook-protected; they are a level-2 change that the Architect's spec review decides, and the Tester checks that every new dependency is named in the task.

## Data rule

No real data in code, fixtures, tests or logs. Demo data is invented. Never read Sascha's real data or real external services from a worker. `.env` is never committed. Never print secrets.

## No outward effects

Agents and their tests change nothing outside the repository and the demo or test environment: no production systems, no real accounts, no real data, no sending, deploying or deleting. Whether and how the product acts on external systems is a product decision recorded in this project's docs.

## Language

Code, identifiers, comments, commit messages, UI texts and demo data: English.

## Paid APIs

Never call real model APIs from tests, scripts or while developing. Use a fake OpenAI-compatible server and scripted implementations.

## Skills

- Developers follow `ponytail` while implementing and use `tdd` for every behaviour change and `diagnosing-bugs` for every bug or review blocker.
- Testers run `ponytail-review` on the full task diff and merge its findings into the review file with the protocol's severities. A Ponytail **Must fix** maps to at least `major`.
- Skills never override this file, the architecture docs or the data and safety rules. On conflict, repository rules win.
- Retro findings change repo files only (`docs/coordinator.md`, `docs/review-protocol.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, or `AGENTS.md` through an accepted ADR). Never edit global or user-level agent configuration.
